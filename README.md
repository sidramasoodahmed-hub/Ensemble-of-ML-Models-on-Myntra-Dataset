# Multiple ML-Models-on-Myntra-Dataset

Ensemble of Machine Learning Models on the Myntra Dataset

This project builds and evaluates multiple machine learning models— including ensemble methods— to predict the article type (articleType) of fashion products on the Myntra platform using categorical and temporal product attributes.

Project Overview

The aim of this notebook is to classify products into their correct articleType (e.g., T-shirt, Dress, Shoes, etc.) based on features such as gender, master category, subcategory, color, season, usage, and year.
The workflow includes data cleaning, EDA, feature encoding, model training, and accuracy comparison.

Input Features

The model uses the following features:

gender

masterCategory

subCategory

baseColour

season

usage

year

Target Variable:

articleType

Methods

The notebook contains the following steps:

• STEP 01 — Data Cleaning

Handling missing values, fixing inconsistent categories, and preparing structured inputs.

• STEP 02 & 03 — EDA & Visualization

Exploring feature distributions, categorical frequencies, and relationships.

• STEP 05 — Machine Learning Models

Includes training and comparing models such as:

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Models are evaluated using classification accuracy.
