# Multiple ML-Models-on-Myntra-Dataset

**Ensemble of Machine Learning Models on the Myntra Dataset**

This project builds and evaluates multiple machine learning models— including ensemble methods— to predict the article type (articleType) of fashion products on the Myntra platform using categorical and temporal product attributes.

**Project Overview**

The aim of this notebook is to classify products into their correct articleType (e.g., T-shirt, Dress, Shoes, etc.) based on features such as gender, master category, subcategory, color, season, usage, and year.
The workflow includes data cleaning, EDA, feature encoding, model training, and accuracy comparison.


**Methods**

The notebook contains the following steps:

• STEP 01 — Data Cleaning

Handling missing values, fixing inconsistent categories, and preparing structured inputs.

• STEP 02 & 03 — EDA & Visualization

Exploring feature distributions, categorical frequencies, and relationships.

• STEP 04 — Machine Learning Models

Includes training and comparing models such as:

1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Gradient Boosting

Models are evaluated using classification accuracy.

**Technologies**
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn
6. Scikit-learn

**Purpose**
This project demonstrates practical skills in:

1. Working with categorical datasets
2. Feature engineering
3. Ensemble machine learning
4. Multi-class classification
5. Real-world retail data analysis
